# ReservationSystemMTF

Project for my alma mater who "ordered" this software for the newly prepared coworking centre. 
<p>This software contains UI which will be able to print reports for receptionist, who is resposible for booking acceptance or denying. For the cenetre visitors will be prepared screens for signing in in relation if they are company, physical entities or students of our faculity.  Users from faculty accounts will not be create their accounts they will use their login values from academic informational system.

**Receptionist user role can:**
- CRUD of the building
- CRUD of the floor
- CRUD of the room
- Deny/Accept the reservation
- Print the reports which contains all reservation for that very day
